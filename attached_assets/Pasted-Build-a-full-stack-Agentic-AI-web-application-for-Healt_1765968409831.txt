Build a full-stack Agentic AI web application for Healthcare Payers called
“Provider Data Validation & Directory Management Agent”.

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Healthcare provider directories contain 40–80% inaccurate data such as phone numbers,
addresses, specialties, and license details. Manual verification is slow, costly, and
causes poor member experience and regulatory risk.

GOAL:
Automate provider data validation and enrichment using publicly available data
sources and AI agents. The system should validate, enrich, score, and manage provider
directory data with minimal human effort.

CORE FEATURES:
1. Upload provider data (CSV) and scanned PDFs (unstructured).
2. Automatically extract provider details from PDFs using OCR / VLM.
3. Validate provider contact information (phone, address, specialty).
4. Cross-check provider identity and credentials using public NPI Registry API.
5. Perform basic web scraping of provider websites (mock URLs allowed).
6. Compare information across multiple sources and detect inconsistencies.
7. Generate confidence scores per data field (phone, address, license, specialty).
8. Flag low-confidence providers for manual review.
9. Auto-generate email drafts requesting provider confirmation.
10. Update provider directory records and generate validation reports.

AGENT ARCHITECTURE:
Create loosely coupled AI agents with clear responsibilities.

Agent 1 – Data Validation Agent:
- Validates phone numbers and addresses.
- Scrapes provider websites and Google Maps listings (mock allowed).
- Cross-checks provider data using NPI Registry API.
- Outputs validated fields with source attribution.

Agent 2 – Information Enrichment Agent:
- Extracts missing provider details from PDFs and websites.
- Adds education, certifications, specialties if available.
- Normalizes and standardizes provider profiles.

Agent 3 – Quality Assurance Agent:
- Compares data from multiple sources.
- Detects inconsistencies and potential fraud.
- Generates confidence scores using weighted logic.
- Flags providers needing human review.

Agent 4 – Directory Management Agent:
- Updates provider directory records.
- Creates prioritized queues for manual verification.
- Generates summary reports and dashboards.
- Drafts communication emails for providers.

USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS:
- Dashboard showing total providers processed.
- Verified vs flagged providers.
- Confidence score visualization.
- Provider profile view with source comparison.
- Downloadable validation report (CSV/PDF).
- Manual review queue with priority levels.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React (simple, clean UI).
- Backend: Python with FastAPI.
- Database: SQLite.
- OCR: Tesseract or Vision-Language Model.
- AI/NLP: OpenAI or HuggingFace models.
- Data processing: Pandas, NumPy.
- Visualization: Charts for KPIs and quality metrics.

DATA:
- Use synthetic provider data (200 records).
- Introduce realistic data quality issues (wrong phone, outdated address).
- Use public data sources where possible; mock where necessary.

KPIs TO DISPLAY:
- Validation accuracy percentage.
- Processing time (target < 30 minutes for 200 providers).
- PDF extraction accuracy.
- Number of providers requiring manual review.

GUARDRAILS:
- Mask any sensitive PII.
- Show confidence scores before allowing updates.
- Human-in-the-loop for low confidence data.

OUTPUT:
- Fully working web application.
- Clear agent orchestration.
- Sample synthetic dataset.
- Demo-ready dashboard.
- Clean, readable code.
